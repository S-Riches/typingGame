A little typing game ive made with vanilla js.

The game gets its words from [](url)https://github.com/dolph/dictionary/blob/master/popular.txt (however i have removed some of the words i felt shouldn't be in the typing game)

The user then has to type the words out, and any mistakes are show at the top of the box.

Also features a keyboard that lights up on keypress.
